# GameDesignProject
* Local multiplayer space brawler where players build their own ships and then battle to blow the rest up in a glorious mess of pew.
* Ships built from components that provide all the shipâ€™s functionality. 
* As the ships take damage, components are lost and ships lose the functionality they provided.
* Control of all the components with activated functions is mapped to buttons on gamepad by the player as they build their ships.
