# GameDesignProject
* Local multiplayer space brawler where players build their own ships and then battle to blow the rest up in a glorious mess of pew.
* Ships built from components that provide all the shipâ€™s functionality. 
* As the ships take damage, components are lost and ships lose the functionality they provided.
* Control of all the components with activated functions is mapped to buttons on gamepad by the player as they build their ships.

# Controls

While building your spaceship you will be prompted to assign buttons on your controller to the components on your ship that can be activated.

By default, the thrusters in your ship will be always mapped to the Left Analog Stick besides the buttons you assign to them.
Also by defined by default, the Back button concedes the battle.
